This cleanup enhances build stability and readability of styles. Checked for potential CSS files and conducted detailed inspection and correction.", "Corrected issues in the Snake game component in components/SnakeGameComponent.vue:\n- Fixed the logic in `checkCollision` to ensure that food is correctly consumed, expanding the snake when it eats food rather than misinterpreting it as a collision event causing a game over.\n- Updated the `restartGame` method to ensure the snake's size resets properly at the start of a new game, preventing it from retaining the previous game's size.", "Resolved a critical bug in 'components/SnakeGameComponent.vue' where the game would inadvertently end when the snake collided with food. The game logic was corrected to ensure the game loop continues after consuming food, thus allowing for proper game progression and score incrementation. This adjustment maintains seamless gameplay and resolves the earlier incorrect game over state."]
