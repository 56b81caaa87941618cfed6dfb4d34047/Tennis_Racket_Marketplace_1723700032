CSS styling was updated for improved game layout aesthetics, particularly enhancing the score display and control button appearances.", "Implemented a basic fully functioning snake game component within the existing Vue 3 project. The component includes essential game logic such as snake movement, collision with food, boundary checks (game over), and a loop timed to run every 100ms.\n\n{\"gameInterval\": Working set interval to run game logic at regular intervals,\n  \"snake\": Initial snake position and data structure setup,\n  \"food\": Positioned randomly at start and each time when consumed by snake,\n  \"direction\": Controls allowing set direction for continuous snake movement\n  \"canvas, context\": Setup a basic canvas rendering environment using the HTML5 canvas element.\n\nNext steps include developing the user interface elements of the Snake Game component, focused on incorporating buttons and score display. Followed by implementing adequate game controls like interactive key inputs for snake navigation and properly styled interfaces to ensure coherent front-end design.", "Added user interface elements to the Snake game component in src/components/SnakeGameComponent.vue. This included a score display feature to track and show the player's score. Buttons for starting, pausing, and restarting the game were implemented for better gameplay control.\n\nChanges made:\n- Added a score display: The score updates whenever the snake eats the food.\n- Start, Pause, Restart buttons were added and are functional.\n\nNext steps include implementing game controls to handle user input for direction changes and enhancing styling for a more engaging visual appeal.", "User interface elements added to the Snake game component in src/components/SnakeGameComponent.vue. This involved:\n- UI for score display with buttons for starting, pausing and restarting the game, enhancing user interaction. \n\nThe Game component is further improved for enhanced styling and control, next steps involve implementing game controls such as snake navigation using keyboard inputs and finalizing responsive styling within the HTML5 canvas element.", "Implemented game controls within the Snake game component in src/components/SnakeGameComponent.vue.

Input controls and aesthetic designs were detailed and tested for effective user interaction and experience. The game component wrapped up previous developments with thorough documentation and optimizations for subsequent extensions as required."]
