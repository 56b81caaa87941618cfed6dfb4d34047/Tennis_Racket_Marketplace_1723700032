The AI then provided a checklist of additional features for potential implementation, which included a successful theme toggle for dark/light modes, a customizable color palette (unchecked), a \u201cSave Preferences\u201d option (checked), an \u201cUndo Changes\u201d button (unchecked), and a preview feature for real-time changes (checked). Further engagement involved the AI asking the user two questions: whether they preferred a saturated or muted dark red background for better aesthetics, and if they wanted text and element colors adjusted for contrast against a dark red background. \n\nSubsequently, the AI inquired about a specific shade of dark purple and clarified whether the background change should apply to the entire website or specific sections. The user confirmed the desire to change the background to dark purple. The AI acknowledged this request and sought more information about the project to proceed effectively.\nAI: Got it. Changing the background to a pile of garbage bags.\nUser: change the background to be a pile of garbage bags\nAI: Acknowledged, I will change the background to a pile of rocks.\nUser: Change the background to be a pile of rocks\nAI: Sure, I can change the background to be an alligator.\nThis is the user's current request of changes to be made: change the background to be a pile of garbage bags"
