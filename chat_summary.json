The user also requested a dark purple background, which the AI confirmed it would adjust. Throughout the conversation, the AI asked the user multiple questions regarding color preferences for backgrounds and text contrast to ensure aesthetic balance. The AI continued to offer additional features relevant to the user's requests, including toggles for light/dark mode, customizable color palettes, and background textures. The conversation concluded with the AI asking for more details about the project to better assist the user.",
